# SharpWallpaper
Ever wanted to change the wallpaper through an executable? Well there you go.

## Usecase:
Your buddy is an employee of bank A.
You have a cobalt strike beacon running on his machine.
Upload an image to his workstation, and use execute-assembly to run the binary along with the full path to the uploaded image (logo of bank B).

## Build:
Use csc.exe from a Visual Studio Developer Command Prompt.
